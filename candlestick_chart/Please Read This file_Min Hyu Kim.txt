Dear sir or madam,

This is applicant Min Hyuk Kim.

Unfortunately, I did not complete the assignment that your company gave to me.

But I would like to let you know about what I have done.


I have done below things.

---------------------------------------

1. Found the CSV parser : Papa Parse, http://papaparse.com/
2. Using the Papa Parser, opened a CSV file and parsed the CSV type texts to JSON array type data.
3. Got the total number of bands created by being devided by period.
4. Got the 'start' and 'end' values to be used in the each band devided by period (100s).
5. Understood what I would have to do but did not complete the rest of the assignment due to the lack of my algorithmic coding experience.
   But I now think that if I knew how to code the related problem efficently, I maybe may solve the entire problems.

----------------------------------------

I am very fast learner and hard-working person. If I am allowed to work as a programmer in your company, then I am quite sure that I will learn everything related to work very fast and contribute your to your company as fast as I can.

I appreciate your kindness for delaying the due date to submit this assignment and thank you for your consideration.


Best regard,

Min Hyuk Kim
